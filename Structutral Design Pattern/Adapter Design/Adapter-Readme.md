Adapter Design Pattern Example
Overview
This Java program demonstrates the Adapter Design Pattern, which allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. In this example, we have a payment system with different payment methods (CreditCardProcessor and PayPalProcessor). The Payment interface acts as a target interface that the client code interacts with, while the CreditCardPaymentAdapter and PayPalPaymentAdapter classes serve as adapters to bridge the gap between the target interface and the specific payment processor interfaces.

Structure
The project consists of the following files:

Payment.java: Defines the Payment interface with a pay method.
CreditCardProcessor.java and PayPalProcessor.java: Adaptee interfaces that define specific payment processing methods.
CreditCardPaymentProcessor.java and PayPalPaymentProcessor.java: Adaptee classes that implement the respective payment processing methods.
CreditCardPaymentAdapter.java and PayPalPaymentAdapter.java: Adapter classes that implement the Payment interface and adapt the specific payment processing methods.
AdapterExample.java: Main class demonstrating the usage of adapters for credit card and PayPal payments.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the example and its structure.
Usage
To run the program, follow these steps:

Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (javac command).

Copy code
javac *.java
Run the AdapterExample class.

Copy code
java AdapterExample
The program will demonstrate credit card and PayPal payments using the Adapter Design Pattern.

Error Handling
The program includes error handling for cases where no payment method is selected or if the adapter is incorrectly initialized.
