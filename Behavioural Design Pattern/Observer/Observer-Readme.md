Observer Design Pattern Example
This Java project demonstrates the Observer Design Pattern, which defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Files
Subject.java: Defines the Subject interface with methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
ConcreteSubject.java: Implements the Subject interface to create a concrete subject that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
Observer.java: Defines the Observer interface with a method to receive updates from the subject.
ConcreteObserver.java: Implements the Observer interface for concrete observers that receive and process updates.
ObserverPatternExample.java: Contains the main method to demonstrate the pattern.
Usage
Compile the Java files using javac *.java.
Run the ObserverPatternExample class to see the pattern in action.
How it Works
Subject is the interface for the subject that can attach, detach, and notify observers.
ConcreteSubject is the concrete subject that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
Observer is the interface for observers that receive updates from the subject.
ConcreteObserver is the concrete observer that implements the update method to receive and process updates.
Error Handling
The example includes error handling when trying to detach an observer that is not attached, ensuring a foolproof design.
