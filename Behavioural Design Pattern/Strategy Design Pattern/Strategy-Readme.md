Strategy Design Pattern Example
This Java project demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern, which defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. The pattern allows the client to choose the algorithm at runtime without modifying the context.

Files
Strategy.java: Defines the Strategy interface with a method to execute a strategy.
ConcreteStrategy1.java: Implements the Strategy interface for the first concrete strategy.
ConcreteStrategy2.java: Implements the Strategy interface for the second concrete strategy.
Context.java: Defines the Context class that maintains the current strategy and executes it.
StrategyPatternExample.java: Contains the main method to demonstrate the pattern.
Usage
Compile the Java files using javac *.java.
Run the StrategyPatternExample class to see the pattern in action.
How it Works
Strategy interface defines a method to execute a strategy.
ConcreteStrategy1 and ConcreteStrategy2 are concrete implementations of the Strategy interface with different strategies.
Context class maintains a reference to the current strategy and executes it based on client's choice.
Error Handling
The example includes error handling for cases where no strategy is set or a null strategy is provided, ensuring a foolproof design
