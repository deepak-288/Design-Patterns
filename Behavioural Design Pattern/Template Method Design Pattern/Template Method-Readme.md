Template Method Design Pattern Example
This Java project demonstrates the Template Method Design Pattern, which defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. The pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Files
AbstractClass.java: Defines the AbstractClass abstract class with the template method and common methods.
ConcreteClass1.java: Implements the specificMethod for the first concrete class.
ConcreteClass2.java: Implements the specificMethod and optionally overrides the hookMethod for the second concrete class.
TemplateMethodExample.java: Contains the main method to demonstrate the pattern.
Usage
Compile the Java files using javac *.java.
Run the TemplateMethodExample class to see the pattern in action.
How it Works
AbstractClass defines the template method (templateMethod) that calls common, specific, and optionally hook methods.
ConcreteClass1 and ConcreteClass2 are concrete implementations of AbstractClass that provide specific implementations for the specificMethod.
hookMethod is an optional hook method that can be overridden in subclasses.
Error Handling
The example does not include specific error handling as the focus is on the template method design and foolproof implementation. However, you can extend the error handling as needed in real-world applications.
