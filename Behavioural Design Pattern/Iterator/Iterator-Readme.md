Iterator Design Pattern Example
This Java project demonstrates the Iterator Design Pattern, which provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

Files
Aggregate.java: Defines the Aggregate interface with a method to create an iterator.
ConcreteAggregate.java: Implements the Aggregate interface to create a concrete aggregate.
Iterator.java: Defines the Iterator interface with methods for iterating over elements.
ConcreteIterator.java: Implements the Iterator interface for a concrete iterator.
IteratorPatternExample.java: Contains the main method to demonstrate the pattern.
Usage
Compile the Java files using javac *.java.
Run the IteratorPatternExample class to see the pattern in action.
How it Works
Aggregate interface defines a method to create an iterator for iterating over elements in an aggregate.
ConcreteAggregate implements Aggregate to create a concrete aggregate and provides access to its elements.
Iterator interface defines methods for iterating over elements, such as hasNext and next.
ConcreteIterator implements Iterator and iterates over elements of a collection in a sequential manner.
In IteratorPatternExample, we create an aggregate, add items to it, create an iterator, and iterate over the items while handling errors for accessing beyond the end of the collection.
Error Handling
The ConcreteIterator class handles the case of trying to access an element beyond the end of the collection by throwing a NoSuchElementException.
