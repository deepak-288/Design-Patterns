Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern Example
This Java project demonstrates the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern, where a request is passed along a chain of handlers until it is handled or no handler is found.

Files
Handler.java: Defines the Handler interface with methods for setting the next handler and handling requests.
ConcreteHandler1.java: Implements the Handler interface for handling Type1 requests.
ConcreteHandler2.java: Implements the Handler interface for handling Type2 requests.
Request.java: Defines the Request class representing a request.
ChainOfResponsibilityPatternExample.java: Contains the main method to demonstrate the pattern.
Usage
Compile the Java files using javac *.java.
Run the ChainOfResponsibilityPatternExample class to see the pattern in action.
How it Works
Handler interface defines the methods for setting the next handler and handling requests.
ConcreteHandler1 and ConcreteHandler2 are concrete handler classes that implement the Handler interface and handle specific types of requests.
Request class represents a request with a request type.
In ChainOfResponsibilityPatternExample, we create instances of the handlers, set the next handler in the chain, create different types of requests, and process the requests to demonstrate the chain of responsibility.
Error Handling
The handlers check if they can handle a request and pass it to the next handler in the chain if not. If no handler can process the request, an appropriate message is displayed.
